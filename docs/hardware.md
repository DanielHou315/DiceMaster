## Electrical Design

### Data Lines
**Screens**
We use 3 SPI buses to connect a total of six screens. To minimize CS switching time, we design an application layer protocol that is similar to CAN, where devices choose to accept/respond to messages based on the device ID. 

SPI 0: 
- SCK: 23
- MISO: 21 (not used)
- MOSI: 19
- CS: 24 (for both screens)

SPI 1: 
- SCK: 40
- MISO: 35 (not used)
- MOSI: 38
- CS: 12 (for both screens)

SPI 3: 
- SCK: 5
- MISO: 28 (not used)
- MOSI: 3
- CS: 27 (for both screens)

**IMU/Battery**
IMU and Battery uses I2C6. 
- SDA: 15
- SCL: 16

**Power Switch**

**Status LED**

**Buttons**
